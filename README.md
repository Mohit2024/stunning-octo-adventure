## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Mohit2024/stunning-octo-adventure/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Mohit2024/stunning-octo-adventure/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## Hello people
Did you know that when first starting out, the most common hooks for people always starts out with a question saying "Did you know?" This isn't great because hooks are supposed to interest people into reading the essay or the rest of your paragraph. Take right now, for example, I'm most likely losing your interest. How do we make it so that people  don't lose interest on what we're writing?
