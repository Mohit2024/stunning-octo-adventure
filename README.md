## Level of Interest
Did you know that when first starting out, the most common hooks for people always starts out with a question saying "Did you know?" This isn't great because hooks are supposed to interest people into reading the essay or the rest of your paragraph. Take right now, for example, I'm most likely losing your interest. How do we make it so that people  don't lose interest on what we're writing? Here's an idea...

See what I just did, I just added a cute dog to try and get you focused on the thing that I am currently writing to you. You feel more inclined because you want to continuously see the cute dog on your screen. However, if I were to post somethng that you didn't like, you would immediately lose interest. For example, this...

Now, because of this, you feel uncomfortable and you don't want to read the rest of my writing. You are probably slowly starting to lose interest to what I have to say. While images aren't always available as you can't use them when turning in an essay, your words should try to represent images. For example, "See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O' that I were a glove upon that hand that I might touch that cheek." This quote is from Romeo and Juliet and after reading this, some people may have an image of this happening in their head. This is good as that is what the sentence is supposed to do, create an image of something that is described in words. Let me try one down below...

## Slipper Scandal
Dress codes in America are strict as 55% of high schools and 70% of middle schools follow strict dress codes. Let me tell you a story about a young boy who definitely isn't me. In sixth grade, someone heard that they had been accepted into a good high school and wasn't sure if they should go. However, they found out that if they didn't go to that school, they would have to go to a middle school where they were told a strict dress code existed. They were also told that the good high school didn't have a strict dress code. This little boy decided to go to the high school believing that he could wear slippers to school. On the first day, he was told he could not wear slippers but wasn't punished due to it being the first day of school. This young boy was scarred for life and scammed by the slippers. He realized now that he was forced to stay in this high school and made a mistake that may have been one of the best mistakes to ever happen. Legend says he is still in that high school, working on homework until 1 am because some teachers aren't aware that multiple teachers assigning homework each day does take a lot of time. While everyone agree that a dress code should exist, it shouldn't be that strict. This is because we deserve freedom, it doesn't focus on the idea of school, and the consequences are harsh. 

### Review
This paragraph is about a young boy who definitely isn't me and was written to try and be a good paragraph. We see here that as a hook, he decides to use statistics instead of a question. This gets people hooked to see more about the rest of the story. After that, an anecdote is stated to try and set a picture in the minds of the readers. This also helps people try to imagine something and gets them more attached to the very sad story of the boy who is definitely not me. After the anecdote is over, an opinion is provided by whoever is writing the paragraph that dress codes should exist but shouldn't be strict. Since I am 100% an English professor that is FDA, CDC, and OSHA approved, I would rate this a 9/10.  

### Final Thoughts
Overall, the hope is that you are able to write better. This can also work with other languages if you happen to write an essay in another language for a reason. Here is an inspirational song. This is for anyone who read till the end and didn't lose interest. Thank you everyone!
